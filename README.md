# C64SVGfxFunctions
Some graphics-related functions written in Assembly for Commodore 64 - Just for fun

I document my experiences while writing code on this arcane system at https://touchingtechnology.wordpress.com/2015/12/01/sprite-flipping-on-commodore-64
Luckily, there are actual good tools available nowadays. But of course, doing even the most trivial things in 6510 assembly language is tough.

The goal of this project is to create a library of functions useful for simple game development on C64.
